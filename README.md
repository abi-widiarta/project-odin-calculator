# The Odin Project | Etch a Sketch

What I Learn :
- nodelist or htmllist doesn't have forEach method, in order to use forEach method it should be converted to array first using Array.from()

Notes for this project :
- string operation is working
- Still has a lot of bugs
- not clean coded yet
- Will be refactored in the future
